Faculty project in Digital Signal Processing


1. ECG signal filtering (baseline drift and power line noise)

1.1 Digital high pass CHEB2 filter to suppress breathing/cable movement induced noise (0.5 - 1Hz)

1.2 Band stop filter with central frequency at 60Hz (EU mains voltage frequency)


2. Sound filtering (check the spectrograms)


3. and 4: Implementation of the direct cannonical and direct cascade filter function realizations (both double and fixed point, with precise calculations for minimal bitlengths possible to keep the filter stable and usable)
